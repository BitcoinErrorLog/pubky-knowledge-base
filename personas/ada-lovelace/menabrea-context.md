THOSE labours which belong to the various branches of the mathematical
sciences, although on first consideration they seem to be the exclusive
province of intellect, may, nevertheless, be divided into two distinct
sections; one of which may be called the mechanical, because it is
subjected to precise and invariable laws, that are capable of being
expressed by means of the operations of matter; while the other,
demanding the intervention of reasoning, belongs more specially to
the domain of the understanding. This admitted, we may propose to
execute, by means of machinery, the mechanical branch of these labours,
reserving for pure intellect that which depends on the reasoning
faculties. Thus the rigid exactness of those laws which regulate
numerical calculations must frequently have suggested the employment
of material instruments, either for executing the whole of such
[Pg 5]
calculations or for abridging them; and thence have arisen several
inventions having this object in view, but which have in general but
partially attained it. For instance, the much-admired machine of Pascal
is now simply an object of curiosity, which, whilst it displays the
powerful intellect of its inventor, is yet of little utility in itself.
Its powers extended no further than the execution of the four[1]
first operations of arithmetic, and indeed were in reality confined
to that of the two first, since multiplication and division were the
result of a series of additions and subtractions. The chief drawback
hitherto on most of such machines is, that they require the continual
intervention of a human agent to regulate their movements, and thence
arises a source of errors; so that, if their use has not become general
for large numerical calculations, it is because they have not in fact
resolved the double problem which the question presents, that of
correctness in the results, united with economy of time.

Struck with similar reflections, Mr. Babbage has devoted some years
to the realization of a gigantic idea. He proposed to himself nothing
less than the construction of a machine capable of executing not merely
arithmetical calculations, but even all those of analysis, if their
laws are known. The imagination is at first astounded at the idea of
such an undertaking; but the more calm reflection we bestow on it,
the less impossible does success appear, and it is felt that it may
depend on the discovery of some principle so general, that if applied
to machinery, the latter may be capable of mechanically translating the
operations which may be indicated to it by algebraical notation. The
illustrious inventor having been kind enough to communicate to me some
[Pg 6]
of his views on this subject during a visit he made at Turin, I have,
with his approbation, thrown together the impressions they have left on
my mind. But the reader must not expect to find a description of Mr.
Babbage’s engine; the comprehension of this would entail studies of
much length; and I shall endeavour merely to give an insight into the
end proposed, and to develope the principles on which its attainment
depends.

I must first premise that this engine is entirely different from that
of which there is a notice in the ‘Treatise on the Economy of Machinery’
by the same author. But as the latter gave rise[2] to the idea of
the engine in question, I consider it will be a useful preliminary
briefly to recall what were Mr. Babbage’s first essays, and also the
circumstances in which they originated.

It is well known that the French government, wishing to promote the
extension of the decimal system, had ordered the construction of
logarithmical and trigonometrical tables of enormous extent. M. de
Prony, who had been entrusted with the direction of this undertaking,
divided it into three sections, to each of which were appointed a
special class of persons. In the first section the formulæ were so
combined as to render them subservient to the purposes of numerical
calculation; in the second, these same formulæ were calculated for
values of the variable, selected at certain successive distances; and
under the third section, comprising about eighty individuals, who were
most of them only acquainted with the two first rules of arithmetic,
the values which were intermediate to those calculated by the second
section were interpolated by means of simple additions and subtractions.

An undertaking similar to that just mentioned having been entered upon
in England, Mr. Babbage conceived that the operations performed under
the third section might be executed by a machine; and this idea he
realized by means of mechanism, which has been in part put together,
[Pg 7]
and to which the name Difference Engine is applicable, on account of
the principle upon which its construction is founded. To give some
notion of this, it will suffice to consider the series of whole square
numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, &c. By subtracting each of these
from the succeeding one, we obtain a new series, which we will name the
Series of First Differences, consisting of the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13, 15, &c. On subtracting from each of these the preceding one, we
obtain the Second Differences, which are all constant and equal to 2.
We may represent this succession of operations, and their results, in
the following table:—

   A. Column of

   Square Numbers.
   B. First

    Differences.
   C. Second

    Differences.

   36

From the mode in which the two last columns B and C have been formed,
it is easy to see that if, for instance, we desire to pass from the
number 5 to the succeeding one 7, we must add to the former the
constant difference 2; similarly, if from the square number 9 we would
pass to the following one 16, we must add to the former the difference
7, which difference is in other words the preceding difference 5, plus
the constant difference 2; or again, which comes to the same thing,
to obtain 16 we have only to add together the three numbers 2, 5,
9, placed obliquely in the direction
a b
. Similarly, we obtain
the number 25 by summing up the three numbers placed in the oblique
direction
d c
: commencing by the addition 2 + 7, we have the
first difference 9 consecutively to 7; adding 16 to the 9 we have the
square 25. We see then that the three numbers 2, 5, 9 being given, the
whole series of successive square numbers, and that of their first
differences likewise, may be obtained by means of simple additions.

Now, to conceive how these operations may be reproduced by a machine,
suppose the latter to have three dials, designated as
A
,
B
,

C
, on each of which are traced, say a thousand divisions, by way of
example, over which a needle shall pass. The two dials,
C
,
B
,
shall have in addition a registering hammer, which is to give a number
of strokes equal to that of the divisions indicated by the needle. For
each stroke of the registering hammer of the dial
C
, the needle

B
 shall advance one division; similarly, the needle
A
 shall
[Pg 8]
advance one division for every stroke of the registering hammer of the
dial
B
. Such is the general disposition of the mechanism.

This being understood, let us at the beginning of the series of
operations we wish to execute, place the needle
C
 on the division
2, the needle
B
 on the division 5, and the needle
A
 on the
division 9. Let us allow the hammer of the dial
C
 to strike; it
will strike twice, and at the same time the needle
B
 will pass
over two divisions. The latter will then indicate the number 7, which
succeeds the number 5 in the column of first differences. If we now
permit the hammer of the dial
B
 to strike in its turn, it will
strike seven times, during which the needle
A
 will advance seven
divisions; these added to the nine already marked by it, will give
the number 16, which is the square number consecutive to 9. If we now
recommence these operations, beginning with the needle
C
, which
is always to be left on the division 2, we shall perceive that by
repeating them indefinitely, we may successively reproduce the series
of whole square numbers by means of a very simple mechanism.

The theorem on which is based the construction of the machine we have
just been describing, is a particular case of the following more
general theorem: that if in any polynomial whatever, the highest power
of whose variable is
m
, this same variable be increased by equal
degrees; the corresponding values of the polynomial then calculated,
and the first, second, third, differences of these be taken (as for the
preceding series of squares); the
m
th differences will all be equal
to each other. So that, in order to reproduce the series of values
of the polynomial by means of a machine analogous to the one above
described, it is sufficient that there be (
m+1
) dials, having the
mutual relations we have indicated. As the differences may be either
positive or negative, the machine will have a contrivance for either
advancing or retrograding each needle, according as the number to be
algebraically added may have the sign plus or minus.

If from a polynomial we pass to a series having an infinite number of
terms, arranged according to the ascending powers of the variable,
it would at first appear, that in order to apply the machine to the
calculation of the function represented by such a series, the mechanism
must include an infinite number of dials, which would in fact render
the thing impossible. But in many cases the difficulty will disappear,
[Pg 9]
if we observe that for a great number of functions the series which
represent them may be rendered convergent; so that, according to
the degree of approximation desired, we may limit ourselves to the
calculation of a certain number of terms of the series, neglecting the
rest. By this method the question is reduced to the primitive case of
a finite polynomial. It is thus that we can calculate the succession
of the logarithms of numbers. But since, in this particular instance,
the terms which had been originally neglected receive increments in a
ratio so continually increasing for equal increments of the variable,
that the degree of approximation required would ultimately be affected,
it is necessary, at certain intervals, to calculate the value of the
function by different methods, and then respectively to use the results
thus obtained, as data whence to deduce, by means of the machine, the
other intermediate values. We see that the machine here performs the
office of the third section of calculators mentioned in describing the
tables computed by order of the French government, and that the end
originally proposed is thus fulfilled by it.

Such is the nature of the first machine which Mr. Babbage conceived. We
see that its use is confined to cases where the numbers required are
such as can be obtained by means of simple additions or subtractions;
that the machine is, so to speak, merely the expression of one[3]
particular theorem of analysis; and that, in short, its operations
cannot be extended so as to embrace the solution of an infinity of
other questions included within the domain of mathematical analysis.
It was while contemplating the vast field which yet remained to be
traversed, that Mr. Babbage, renouncing his original essays, conceived
the plan of another system of mechanism whose operations should
themselves possess all the generality of algebraical notation, and
which, on this account, he denominates the Analytical Engine.

Having now explained the state of the question, it is time for me to
develope the principle on which is based the construction of this
latter machine. When analysis is employed for the solution of any
problem, there are usually two classes of operations to execute:
firstly, the numerical calculation of the various coefficients; and
secondly, their distribution in relation to the quantities affected by
them. If, for example, we have to obtain the product of two binomials
[Pg 10]
(
a+bx
), the result will be represented by
am + (an + bm)

x + bnx^{2}
 in which expression we must first calculate
am
,

an
,
bm
,
bn
; then take the sum of
an + bm
; and lastly,
respectively distribute the coefficients thus obtained, amongst the
powers of the variable. In order to reproduce these operations by means
of a machine, the latter must therefore possess two distinct sets of
powers: first, that of executing numerical calculations; secondly, that
of rightly distributing the values so obtained.

But if human intervention were necessary for directing each of
these partial operations, nothing would be gained under the heads
of correctness and economy of time; the machine must therefore have
the additional requisite of executing by itself all the successive
operations required for the solution of a problem proposed to it, when
once the primitive numerical data for this same problem have
been introduced. Therefore, since from the moment that the nature of
the calculation to be executed or of the problem to be resolved have
been indicated to it, the machine is, by its own intrinsic power, of
itself to go through all the intermediate operations which lead to the
proposed result, it must exclude all methods of trial and guess-work,
and can only admit the direct processes of calculation[4].

It is necessarily thus; for the machine is not a thinking being, but
simply an automaton which acts according to the laws imposed upon it.
This being fundamental, one of the earliest researches its author had
to undertake, was that of finding means for effecting the division of
one number by another without using the method of guessing indicated
by the usual rules of arithmetic. The difficulties of effecting
this combination were far from being among the least; but upon it
depended the success of every other. Under the impossibility of my
here explaining the process through which this end is attained, we
must limit ourselves to admitting that the four first operations of
arithmetic, that is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
can be performed in a direct manner through the intervention of the
machine. This granted, the machine is thence capable of performing
every species of numerical calculation, for all such calculations
ultimately resolve themselves into the four operations we have just
[Pg 11]
named. To conceive how the machine can now go through its functions
according to the laws laid down, we will begin by giving an idea of the
manner in which it materially represents numbers.

Let us conceive a pile or vertical column consisting of an indefinite
number of circular discs, all pierced through their centres by a common
axis, around which each of them can take an independent rotatory
movement. If round the edge of each of these discs are written the
ten figures which constitute our numerical alphabet, we may then,
by arranging a series of these figures in the same vertical line,
express in this manner any number whatever. It is sufficient for this
purpose that the first disc represent units, the second tens, the third
hundreds, and so on. When two numbers have been thus written on two
distinct columns, we may propose to combine them arithmetically with
each other, and to obtain the result on a third column. In general, if
we have a series of columns[5] consisting of discs, which columns w e
will designate as
V_0
,
V_1
,
V_2
,

V_3
,
V_4
, &c., we may require, for instance,
to divide the number written on the column
V_1
 by that on
the column
V_4
, and to obtain the result on the column

V_7
. To effect this operation, must impart to the machine
two distinct arrangements; through the first it is prepared for
executing a division, and through the second the columns it is
to operate on are indicated to it, and also the column on which the
result is to be represented. If this division is to be followed, for
example, by the addition of two numbers taken on other columns, the two
original arrangements of the machine must be simultaneously altered.
If, on the contrary, a series of operations of the same nature is to be
gone through, then the first of the original arrangements will remain,
and the second alone must be altered. Therefore, the arrangements
that may be communicated to the various parts of the machine, may be
distinguished into two principal classes:

First, that relative to the Operations.

Secondly, that relative to the Variables.

By this latter we mean that which indicates the columns to be operated
on. As for the operations themselves, they are executed by a special
apparatus, which is designated by the name of mill, and which
itself contains a certain number of columns, similar to those of
the Variables. When two numbers are to be combined together, the
[Pg 12]
machine commences by effacing them from the columns where they are
written, that is it places zero[6] on every disc of the two
vertical lines on which the numbers were represented; and it transfers
the numbers to the mill. There, the apparatus having been disposed
suitably for the required operation, this latter is effected, and, when
completed, the result itself is transferred to the column of Variables
which shall have been indicated. Thus the mill is that portion of the
machine which works, and the columns of Variables constitute that
where the results are represented and arranged. After the preceding
explanations, we may perceive that all fractional and irrational
results will be represented in decimal fractions. Supposing each column
to have forty discs, this extension will be sufficient for all degrees
of approximation generally required.

It will now be inquired how the machine can of itself, and without
having recourse to the hand of man, assume the successive dispositions
suited to the operations. The solution of this problem has been taken
from Jacquard’s apparatus[7], used for the manufacture of brocaded
stuffs, in the following manner:—

Two species of threads are usually distinguished in woven stuffs; one
is the warp or longitudinal thread, the other the woof
or transverse thread, which is conveyed by the instrument called the
shuttle, and which crosses the longitudinal thread or warp. When a
brocaded stuff is required, it is necessary in turn to prevent certain
threads from crossing the woof, and this according to a succession
which is determined by the nature of the design that is to be
reproduced. Formerly this process was lengthy and difficult, and it
was requisite that the workman, by attending to the design which he
was to copy, should himself regulate the movements the threads were
to take. Thence arose the high price of this description of stuffs,
especially if threads of various colours entered into the fabric. To
simplify this manufacture, Jacquard devised the plan of connecting
each group of threads that were to act together, with a distinct lever
belonging exclusively to that group. All these levers terminate in
rods, which are united together in one bundle, having usually the form
of a parallelopiped with a rectangular base. The rods are cylindrical,
and are separated from each other by small intervals. The process of
[Pg 13]
raising the threads is thus resolved into that of moving these various
lever-arms in the requisite order. To effect this, a rectangular
sheet of pasteboard is taken, somewhat larger in size than a section
of the bundle of lever-arms. If this sheet be applied to the base
of the bundle, and an advancing motion be then communicated to the
pasteboard, this latter will move with it all the rods of the bundle,
and consequently the threads that are connected with each of them. But
if the pasteboard, instead of being plain, were pierced with holes
corresponding to the extremities of the levers which meet it, then,
since each of the levers would pass through the pasteboard during the
motion of the latter, they would all remain in their places. We thus
see that it is easy so to determine the position of the holes in the
pasteboard, that, at any given moment, there shall be a certain number
of levers, and consequently of parcels of threads, raised, while the
rest remain where they were. Supposing this process is successively
repeated according to a law indicated by the pattern to be executed,
we perceive that this pattern may be reproduced on the stuff. For this
purpose we need merely compose a series of cards according to the law
required, and arrange them in suitable order one after the other; then,
by causing them to pass over a polygonal beam which is so connected as
to turn a new face for every stroke of the shuttle, which face shall
then be impelled parallelly to itself against the bundle of lever-arms,
the operation of raising the threads will be regularly performed. Thus
we see that brocaded tissues may be manufactured with a precision and
rapidity formerly difficult to obtain.

Arrangements analogous to those just described have been introduced
into the Analytical Engine. It contains two principal species of cards:
first, Operation cards, by means of which the parts of the machine are
so disposed as to execute any determinate series of operations, such
as additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions; secondly,
cards of the Variables, which indicate to the machine the columns on
which the results are to be represented. The cards, when put in motion,
successively arrange the various portions of the machine according to
the nature of the processes that are to be effected, and the machine at
the same time executes these processes by means of the various pieces
of mechanism of which it is constituted.

In order more perfectly to conceive the thing, let us select as an
[Pg 14]
example the resolution of two equations of the first degree with two
unknown quantities. Let the following be the two equations, in which

x
 and
y
 are the unknown quantities:—

resolution of two equations of first degree with two unknown quantities

We deduce
x={dn′- d′}/(n′m - nm′}
, and for
y
 an
analogous expression. Let us continue to represent by
V_0
,

V_1
,
V_2
, &c. the different columns which
contain the numbers, and let us suppose that the first eight columns
have been chosen for expressing on them the numbers represented by

m
,
n
,
d
,
m′
,
m′
,
d′
,
n
 and
n′
, which
implies that
V_0=m
,
V_1=n
,
V_2=d
,

V_3=m′
,
V_4
,
V_5=d′
,

V_6=n
,
V_7=n′
.

The series of operations commanded by the cards, and the results
obtained, may be represented in the following table:—

Since the cards do nothing but indicate in what manner and on what
columns the machine shall act, it is clear that we must still, in every
particular case, introduce the numerical data for the calculation.
Thus, in the example we have selected, we must previously inscribe the
numerical values of
m
,
n
,
d
,
m′
,
n′
,
d′
, in the
order and on the columns indicated, after which the machine when put
in action will give the value of the unknown quantity
x
 for this
particular case. To obtain the value of another series of operations
analogous to the preceding must be performed. But we see that they
will be only four in number, since the denominator of the expression
for
y
, excepting the sign, is the same as that for
x
 and equal
to
n′m-nm′
. In the preceding table it will be remarked that the
column for operations indicates four successive multiplications,
two subtractions, and one division. Therefore, if
[Pg 15]
desired, we need only use three operation cards; to manage which, it
is sufficient to introduce into the machine an apparatus which shall,
after the first multiplication, for instance, retain the card which
relates to this operation, and not allow it to advance so as to be
replaced by another one, until after this same operation shall have
been four times repeated. In the preceding example we have seen, that
to find the value of
x
 we must begin by writing the coefficients

m
,
n
,
d
,
m′
,
n′
,
d′
 upon eight columns, thus
repeating
n
 and
n′
 twice. According to the same method, if it
were required to calculate
y
 likewise, these coefficients must be
written on twelve different columns. But it is possible to simplify
this process, and thus to diminish the chances of errors, which chances
are greater, the larger the number of the quantities that have to be
inscribed previous to setting the machine in action. To understand this
simplification, we must remember that every number written on a column
must, in order to be arithmetically combined with another number,
be effaced from the column on which it is, and transferred to the
mill. Thus, in the example we have discussed, we will take the
two coefficients
m
 and
n′
, which are each of them to enter into
two different products, that is
m
 into
mn′
 and
md′
,
n′

into
mn′
 and
n′d
. These coefficients will be inscribed on the
columns
V_0
 and
V_4
. If we commence the
series of operations by the product of
m
 into
n′
, these numbers
will be effaced from the columns
V_0
 and
V_4
,
that they may be transferred to the mill, which will multiply them into
each other, and will then command the machine to represent the result,
say on the column
V_6
. But as these numbers are each
to be used again in another operation, they must again be inscribed
somewhere; therefore, while the mill is working out their product,
the machine will inscribe them anew on any two columns that may be
indicated to it through the cards; and, as in the actual case, there
is no reason why they should not resume their former places, we will
suppose them again inscribed on
V_0
 and
V_4
,
whence in short they would not finally disappear, to be reproduced no
more, until they should have gone through all the combinations in which
they might have to be used.

[Pg 16]

resolving the two[8] above equations of the first degree, may be

In order to diminish to the utmost the chances of error in inscribing
the numerical data of the problem, they are successively placed on one
of the columns of the mill; then, by means of cards arranged for this
purpose, these same numbers are caused to arrange themselves on the
requisite columns, without the operator having to give his attention to
it; so that his undivided mind may be applied to the simple inscription
of these same numbers.

According to what has now been explained, we see that the collection
of columns of Variables may be regarded as a store of numbers,
accumulated there by the mill, and which, obeying the orders
transmitted to the machine by means of the cards, pass alternately from
the mill to the store, and from the store to the mill, that they may
undergo the transformations demanded by the nature of the calculation
to be performed.

Hitherto no mention has been made of the signs in the results,
and the machine would be far from perfect were it incapable of
[Pg 17]
expressing and combining amongst each other positive and negative
quantities. To accomplish this end, there is, above every column, both
of the mill and of the store, a disc, similar to the discs of which
the columns themselves consist. According as the digit on this disc is
even or uneven, the number inscribed on the corresponding column below
it will be considered as positive or negative. This granted, we may,
in the following manner, conceive how the signs can be algebraically
combined in the machine. When a number is to be transferred from the
store to the mill, and vice versâ, it will always be transferred
with its sign, which will be effected by means of the cards, as has
been explained in what precedes. Let any two numbers then, on which
we are to operate arithmetically, be placed in the mill with their
respective signs. Suppose that we are first to add them together; the
operation-cards will command the addition: if the two numbers be of
the same sign, one of the two will be entirely effaced from w here it
was inscribed, and will go to add itself on the column which contains
the other number; the machine will, during this operation, be able, by
means of a certain apparatus, to prevent any movement in the disc of
signs which belongs to the column on which the addition is made, and
thus the result will remain with the sign which the two given numbers
originally had. When two numbers have two different signs, the addition
commanded by the card will be changed into a subtraction through the
intervention of mechanisms which are brought into play by this very
difference of sign. Since the subtraction can only be effected on
the larger of the two numbers, it must be arranged that the disc of
signs of the larger number shall not move while the smaller of the two
numbers is being effaced from its column and subtracted from the other,
whence the result will have the sign of this latter, just as in fact
it ought to be. The combinations to which algebraical subtraction give
rise, are analogous to the preceding. Let us pass on to multiplication.
When two numbers to be multiplied are of the same sign, the result is
positive; if the signs are different, the product must be negative.
In order that the machine may act conformably to this law, we have
but to conceive that, on the column containing the product of the two
given numbers, the digit which indicates the sign of that product, has
been formed by the mutual addition of the two digits that respectively
indicated the signs of the two given numbers; it is then obvious that
[Pg 18]
if the digits of the signs are both even, or both odd, their sum will
be an even number, and consequently will express a positive number; but
that if, on the contrary, the two digits of the signs are one even and
the other odd, their sum will be an odd number, and will consequently
express a negative number. In the case of division, instead of adding
the digits of the discs, they must be subtracted one from the other,
which will produce results analogous to the preceding; that is to say,
that if these figures are both even or both uneven, the remainder of
this subtraction will be even; and it will be uneven in the contrary
case. When I speak of mutually adding or subtracting the numbers
expressed by the digits of the signs, I merely mean that one of the
sign-discs is made to advance or retrograde a number of divisions equal
to that which is expressed by the digit on the other sign-disc. We see,
then, from the preceding explanation, that it is possible mechanically
to combine the signs of quantities so as to obtain results conformable
to those indicated by algebra[9].

The machine is not only capable of executing those numerical
calculations which depend on a given algebraical formula, but it
is also fitted for analytical calculations in which there are one
or several variables to be considered. It must be assumed that the
analytical expression to be operated on can be developed according
to powers of the variable, or according to determinate functions of
this same variable, such as circular functions, for instance; and
similarly for the result that is to be attained. If we then suppose
that above the columns of the store, we have inscribed the powers
or the functions of the variable, arranged according to whatever
is the prescribed law of development, the coefficients of these
several terms may be respectively placed on the corresponding column
below each. In this manner we shall have a representation of an
analytical development; and, supposing the position of the several
terms composing it to be invariable, the problem will be reduced to
that of calculating their coefficients according to the laws demanded
by the nature of the question. In order to make this more clear, we
shall take the following:[10] very simple example, in which we are
[Pg 19]
to multiply (
a+bx′
) by (
A+B cos^1 x
). We shall begin by
writing
x^0
,
x^1
,
cos^0 x
,
cos^1 x
, above the columns

V_0
,
V_1
,
V_12
,
V_3
;
then, since from the form of the two functions to be combined, the
terms which are to compose the products will be of the following
nature,
x^0 x cos^0
,
x^0 x cos^1 x
,

x^1 x cos^0 x
,
x^1 x cos^1 x
; these will be
inscribed above the columns
V_4
,
V_5
,

V_6
,
V_7
. The coefficients of
x^0
,

x^1
,
cos^0 x
,
cos^1 x
 being given, they will, by means of
the mill, be passed to the columns
V_0
,
V_1
,

V_2
 and
V_3
. Such are the primitive data of
the problem. It is now the business of the machine to work out its
solution, that is to find the coefficients which are to be inscribed on

V_4
,
V_5
,
V_6
,
V_7
.
To attain this object, the law of formation of these same coefficients
being known, the machine will act through the intervention of the
cards, in the manner indicated by the following table:—

It will now be perceived that a general application may be made of
the principle developed in the preceding example, to every species
of process which it may be proposed to effect on series submitted
to calculation. It is sufficient that the law of formation of the
coefficients be known, and that this law be inscribed on the cards of
the machine, which will then of itself execute all the calculations
[Pg 20]
requisite for arriving at the proposed result. If, for instance,
a recurring series were proposed, the law of formation of the
coefficients being here uniform, the same operations which must be
performed for one of them will be repeated for all the others; there
will merely be a change in the locality of the operation, that is
it will be performed with different columns. Generally, since every
analytical expression is susceptible of being expressed in a series
ordered according to certain functions of the variable, we perceive
that the machine will include all analytical calculations which can
be definitively reduced to the formation of coefficients according to
certain laws, and to the distribution of these with respect to the
variables.

We may deduce the following important consequence from these
explanations, viz. that since the cards only indicate the nature of the
operations to be performed, and the columns of Variables with which
they are to be executed, these cards will themselves possess all the
generality of analysis, of which they are in fact merely a translation.
We shall now further examine some of the difficulties which the machine
must surmount, if its assimilation to analysis is to be complete. There
are certain functions which necessarily change in nature when they pass
through zero or infinity, or whose values cannot be admitted when they
pass these limits. When such cases present themselves, the machine is
able, by means of a bell, to give notice that the passage through zero
or infinity is taking place, and it then stops until the attendant has
again set it in action for whatever process it may next be desired that
it shall perform. If this process has been foreseen, then the machine,
instead of ringing, will so dispose itself as to present the new cards
which have relation to the operation that is to succeed the passage
through zero and infinity. These new cards may follow the first, but
may only come into play contingently upon one or other of the two
circumstances just mentioned taking place.

Let us consider a term of the form
ab^n
; since the cards are
but a translation of the analytical formula, their number in this
particular case must be the same, whatever be the value of
n
; that
is to say, whatever be the number of multiplications required for
elevating
b
 to the
n
th power (we are supposing for the moment
that
n
 is a whole number). Now, since the exponent
n
 indicates
that
b
 is to be multiplied
n
 times by itself, and all these
operations are of the same nature, it will be sufficient to employ one
[Pg 21]
single operation-card, viz. that which orders the multiplication.

But when
n
 is given for the particular case to be calculated,
it will be further requisite that the machine limit the number of
its multiplications according to the given values. The process may
be thus arranged. The three numbers
a
,
b
 and
n
 will be
written on as many distinct columns of the store; we shall designate
them
V_0
,
V_1
,
V_2
; the result

ab^2
 will place itself on the column
V_3
. When the
number
n
 has been introduced into the machine, a card will order
a certain registering-apparatus to mark (
n-1
), and will at the
same time execute the multiplication of
b
 by
b
. When this is
completed, it will be found that the registering-apparatus has effaced
a unit, and that it only marks (
n-2
); while the machine will now
again order the number
b
 written on the column
V_1

to multiply itself with the product
b^2
 written on the column

V_3
, which will give
b^3
. Another unit is then effaced
from the registering-apparatus, and the same processes are continually
repeated until it only marks zero. Thus the number
b^n
 will be
found inscribed on
V_3
, when the machine, pursuing its
course of operations, will order the product of
b^n
 by
a
; and
the required calculation will have been completed without there being
any necessity that the number of operation-cards used should vary
with the value of
n
. If
n
 were negative, the cards, instead
of ordering the multiplication of
a
 by
b^n
, would order its
division; this we can easily conceive, since every number, being
inscribed with its respective sign, is consequently capable of reacting
on the nature of the operations to be executed. Finally, if
n
 were
fractional, of the form
p/q
, an additional column would
be used for the inscription of
q
, and the machine would bring into
action two sets of processes, one for raising
b
 to the power
p
,
the other for extracting the
q
th root of the number so obtained.

Again, it may be required, for example, to multiply an expression of
the form
ax^m-bx^n
 by another
Ax^p+Bx^q
,
and then to reduce the product to the least number of terms,
if any of the indices are equal. The two factors being ordered with
respect to
x
, the general result of the multiplication would be

Aax^(n+p)+Bax^(n+q)
.
Up to this point the process presents no difficulties; but suppose
that we have
m=p
 and
n=q
, and that we wish to reduce the two middle terms to a single one (
{A}b + {B}a)x^{m+q}
.
[Pg 22]
For this purpose, the cards may order
m+q
 and
n+p

to be transferred into the mill, and there subtracted one from
the other; if the remainder is nothing, as would be the case on the
present hypothesis, the mill will order other cards to bring to it the
coefficients
aB
 and
Ba
, that it may add them
together and give them in this state as a coefficient for the single
term
x^{n+q} = x^{m+q}
.

This example illustrates how the cards are able to reproduce all the
operations which intellect performs in order to attain a determinate
result, if these operations are themselves capable of being precisely
defined.

Let us now examine the following expression:—

2 x 2^2 x 4^2 x 6^2 x 8^2 x 10^2 ... 2n^2/1^2 x 3^2 x 5^2 x 7^2 x 9^2 ... (2n-1^2

which we know becomes equal to the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter, when
n
 is infinite. We may require the machine not only
to perform the calculation of this fractional expression, but further
to give indication as soon as the value becomes identical with that of
the ratio of the circumference to the diameter when
n
 is infinite,
a case in which the computation would be impossible. Observe that we
should thus require of the machine to interpret a result not of itself
evident, and that this is not amongst its attributes, since it is no
thinking being. Nevertheless, when the
cos
 of
 n=infty
 has
been foreseen, a card may immediately order the substitution of the
value of
pi
, (
pi
 being the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter), without going through the series of calculations indicated.
This would merely require that the machine contain a special card,
whose office it should be to place the number
pi
 in a direct
and independent manner on the column indicated to it. And here we
should introduce the mention of a third species of cards, which may
be called cards of numbers. There are certain numbers, such
as those expressing the ratio of the circumference to the diameter,
the Numbers of Bernoulli, &c., which frequently present themselves in
calculations. To avoid the necessity for computing them every time they
have to be used, certain cards may be combined specially in order to
give these numbers ready made into the mill, whence they afterwards go
and place themselves on those columns of the store that are destined
for them. Through this means the machine will be susceptible of
those simplifications afforded by the use of numerical tables. It
[Pg 23]
would be equally possible to introduce, by means of these cards, the
logarithms of numbers; but perhaps it might not be in this case either
the shortest or the most appropriate method; for the machine might
be able to perform the same calculations by other more expeditious
combinations, founded on the rapidity with which it executes the four
first operations of arithmetic. To give an idea of this rapidity, we
need only mention that Mr. Babbage believes he can, by his engine, form
the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three
minutes.

Perhaps the immense number of cards required for the solution of any
rather complicated problem may appear to be an obstacle; but this does
not seem to be the case. There is no limit to the number of cards that
can be used. Certain stuffs require for their fabrication not less than
twenty thousand cards, and we may unquestionably far exceed even
this quantity[12].

Resuming what we have explained concerning the Analytical Engine, we
may conclude that it is based on two principles: the first, consisting
in the fact that every arithmetical calculation ultimately depends on
four principal operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division; the second, in the possibility of reducing every analytical
calculation to that of the coefficients for the several terms of a
series. If this last principle be true, all the operations of analysis
come within the domain of the engine. To take another point of view:
the use of the cards offers a generality equal to that of algebraical
formulæ, since such a formula simply indicates the nature and order of
the operations requisite for arriving at a certain definite result, and
similarly the cards merely command the engine to perform these same
operations; but in order that the mechanisms may be able to act to any
purpose, the numerical data of the problem must in every particular
case be introduced. Thus the same series of cards will serve for all
questions whose sameness of nature is such as to require nothing
altered excepting the numerical data. In this light the cards are
merely a translation of algebraical formulæ, or, to express it better,
another form of analytical notation.

Since the engine has a mode of acting peculiar to itself, it will
in every particular case be necessary to arrange the series of
calculations conformably to the means which the machine possesses; for
[Pg 24]
such or such a process which might be very easy for a calculator, may
be long and complicated for the engine, and vice versâ.

Considered under the most general point of view, the essential object
of the machine being to calculate, according to the laws dictated
to it, the values of numerical coefficients which it is then to
distribute appropriately on the columns which represent the variables,
it follows that the interpretation of formulæ and of results is
beyond its province, unless indeed this very interpretation be itself
susceptible of expression by means of the symbols which the machine
employs. Thus, although it is not itself the being that reflects, it
may yet be considered as the being which executes the conceptions of
intelligence[13]. The cards receive the impress of these conceptions,
and transmit to the various trains of mechanism composing the engine
the orders necessary for their action. When once the engine shall have
been constructed, the difficulty will be reduced to the making out
of the cards; but as these are merely the translation of algebraical
formulæ, it will, by means of some simple notations, be easy to consign
the execution of them to a workman. Thus the whole intellectual labour
will be limited to the preparation of the formulæ, which must be
adapted for calculation by the engine.

Now, admitting that such an engine can be constructed, it may be
inquired: what will be its utility? To recapitulate; it will afford the
following advantages:—First, rigid accuracy. We know that numerical
calculations are generally the stumbling-block to the solution of
problems, since errors easily creep into them, and it is by no means
always easy to detect these errors. Now the engine, by the very nature
of its mode of acting, which requires no human intervention during the
course of its operations, presents every species of security under the
head of correctness; besides, it carries with it its own check; for
at the end of every operation it prints off, not only the results,
but likewise the numerical data of the question; so that it is easy
to verify whether the question has been correctly proposed. Secondly,
economy of time: to convince ourselves of this, we need only recollect
that the multiplication of two numbers, consisting each of twenty
figures, requires at the very utmost three minutes. Likewise, when
a long series of identical computations is to be performed, such as
those required for the formation of numerical tables, the machine can
[Pg 25]
be brought into play so as to give several results at the same time,
which will greatly abridge the whole amount of the processes. Thirdly,
economy of intelligence: a simple arithmetical computation requires to
be performed by a person possessing some capacity; and when we pass
to more complicated calculations, and wish to use algebraical formulæ
in particular cases, knowledge must be possessed which pre-supposes
preliminary mathematical studies of some extent. Now the engine, from
its capability of performing by itself all these purely material
operations, spares intellectual labour, which may be more profitably
employed. Thus the engine may be considered as a real manufactory of
figures, which will lend its aid to those many useful sciences and
arts that depend on numbers. Again, who can foresee the consequences
of such an invention? In truth, how many precious observations
remain practically barren for the progress of the sciences, because
there are not powers sufficient for computing the results! And what
discouragement does the perspective of a long and arid computation
cast into the mind of a man of genius, who demands time exclusively
for meditation, and who beholds it snatched from him by the material
routine of operations! Yet it is by the laborious route of analysis
that he must reach truth; but he cannot pursue this unless guided by
numbers; for without numbers it is not given us to raise the veil
which envelopes the mysteries of nature. Thus the idea of constructing
an apparatus capable of aiding human weakness in such researches, is
a conception which, being realized, would mark a glorious epoch in
the history of the sciences. The plans have been arranged for all the
various parts, and for all the wheel-work, which compose this immense
apparatus, and their action studied; but these have not yet been fully
combined together in the drawings[14] and mechanical notation[15].
The confidence which the genius of Mr. Babbage must inspire, affords
legitimate ground for hope that this enterprise will be crowned with
success; and while we render homage to the intelligence which directs
it, let us breathe aspirations for the accomplishment of such an
undertaking.

FOOTNOTES:

[1]
This remark seems to require further comment, since it
is in some degree calculated to strike the mind as being at variance
with the subsequent passage (page 10), where it is explained that
an engine which can effect these four operations can in fact
effect every species of calculation. The apparent discrepancy
is stronger too in the translation than in the original, owing to its
being impossible to render precisely into the English tongue all the
niceties of distinction which the French idiom happens to admit of in
the phrases used for the two passages we refer to. The explanation lies
in this: that in the one case the execution of these four operations
is the fundamental starting-point, and the object proposed for
attainment by the machine is the subsequent combination of these
in every possible variety; whereas in the other case the execution
of some one of these four operations, selected at pleasure, is the
ultimatum, the sole and utmost result that can be proposed for
attainment by the machine referred to, and which result it cannot
any further combine or work upon. The one begins where the other
ends. Should this distinction not now appear perfectly clear, it
will become soon perusing the rest of the Memoir, and the Notes that
are appended to it.—NOTE BY TRANSLATOR.

The idea that the one engine is the offspring and has
grown out of the other, is an exceedingly natural and plausible
supposition, until reflection reminds us that no necessary
sequence and connexion need exist between two such inventions, and that
they may be wholly independent, M. Menabrea has shared this idea
in common with persons who have not his profound and accurate insight
into the nature of either engine. In Note A. (see the Notes at the
end of the Memoir) it will be found sufficiently explained, however,
that this supposition is unfounded. M. Menabrea’s opportunities were
by no means such as could be adequate to afford him information on a
point like this, which would be naturally and almost unconsciously
assumed, and would scarcely suggest any inquiry with reference
to it.—NOTE BY TRANSLATOR.

Not having had leisure to discuss with Mr. Babbage the

to point out one means that might be employed for resolving this
